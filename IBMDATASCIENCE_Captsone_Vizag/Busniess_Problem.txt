A description of the problem and a discussion of the background. 

Business Problem Â¶
This project deals with discussing the neighborhoods of Visakhapatnam,India. 
This project would specifically help Business people planning to start Restaurants, Hotels, etc. in Visakhapatnam, Andhrapradesh, India.

The Foursquare API is used to access the venues in the neighborhoods. 
Since, it returns less venues in the neighborhoods, we would be analysing areas for which countable number of venues are obtained. 
Then they are clustered based on their venues using Data Science Techniques. Here the k-means clustering algorithm is used to achieve the task.
Folium visualization library can be used to visualize the clusters superimposed on the map of Chennai city. 
These clusters can be analyzed to help small scale business owners select a suitable location for their need such as Hotels, 
Shopping Malls, Restaurants or even specifically Indian restaurants or Coffee shops.

The major Target Audience would be small-scale business owners and stake holders planning to start their business at a location in Chennai.
